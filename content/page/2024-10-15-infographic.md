::div{.playfair-display}
In the first semester of my first year, I designed an infographic on the theme of time, focusing on the issue of time lost due to traffic congestion. As a solution, I developed an innovative invention aimed at reducing time wasted in traffic.

Throughout the design process, I explored various perspectives and ultimately chose an isometric view. This allowed me to clearly and effectively display each aspect of the solution.

For the layout, I opted for a compact and structured design, which ensured that all elements were logically aligned. This resulted in a clear and visually appealing presentation of both the problem and the solution.
