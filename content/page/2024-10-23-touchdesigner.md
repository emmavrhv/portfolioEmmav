For this assignment we were tasked with exploring a specific color contrast and creating a representation of it in the spatial computing lab. The goal was to keep the design as simple as possible while ensuring it remained interactive.

I started by selecting a contrast that I wanted to work with, choosing complementary colors. These are the colors that are placed opposite each other on Itten's color wheel. I then proceeded to work with this concept in TouchDesigner.
