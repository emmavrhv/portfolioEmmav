::div{.playfair-display} 
I’m Emma Verhoeven, a 19-year-old student in my second year of Media & Information Design at LUCA School of Arts. Originally from Sint-Genesius-Rode, I have always been drawn to both digital and traditional forms of creative expression.

Throughout my studies and personal projects, I’ve built a range of skills across different media. My work spans from graphic design and digital experiences to more hands-on techniques like drawing and painting. This diverse foundation enables me to approach design challenges with both technical expertise and an artistic mindset.

At LUCA, I’m refining my ability to translate concepts into innovative projects in media and information design. With a strong focus on storytelling and creativity, I aim to create visual experiences that are not only visually compelling but also functional and meaningful. My portfolio reflects my growth as a designer and my commitment to exploring new ways of engaging with audiences.
